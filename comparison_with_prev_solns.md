### Drawbacks of Previous Solutions

- Limited adaptability (dependence on pre-programmed behaviors)
- No mechanism for continuous improvement in real-time applications
- Challenges in real-time RL due to computational and practical complexities.


The integration of free gait generation with reinforcement learning addresses some limitations of earlier methods: 

1. **Continuous Improvement and Adaptation**: The reinforcement learning component allows for the continuous improvement of gaits based on stability margins. This leads to the robot adapting more stable gaits over time, enhancing its walking efficiency and stability, even under normal conditions without external effects of instability.

2. **Smooth Transition Between Speeds**: The algorithm facilitates smooth transitions between different commanded speeds, demonstrating a peculiar feature of slowing down and then adapting to a new speed in just a few steps. This smooth transition capability marks a significant improvement over previous methods that may not have accounted for dynamic speed changes as effectively.

3. **Learning to Walk with a Rear-Leg Deficiency**: The paper highlights the robot's ability to adapt to the unexpected condition of a rear-leg deficiency. Despite generating statically stable gaits, the robot initially experiences falls due to the leg deficiency. However, through negative reinforcement, it learns to avoid falls by memorizing and using stable states. This adaptation is critical in demonstrating the robot's capability to overcome physical handicaps through learning.

4. **Real Robot Application**: Unlike many previous solutions that were confined to simulations or theoretical models, the FGGRL algorithm is successfully implemented and tested on the actual Robot-EA308. This application to a real-world scenario demonstrates the practical viability of the solution.


conclusion: the FGGRL algorithm provides a better solution in terms of adaptability, stability, efficiency, and practical applicability compared to previous approaches.
