The reinforcement learning environment described in the paper for a six-legged robot involves several key mathematical components to define the states, actions, rewards, and the learning mechanism itself. Here's a breakdown of the reinforcement learning (RL) environment using mathematical terms based on the provided information:

1. **State Space (S)**: The state of the robot is defined by the positions of all six legs, represented as a vector $\(P = [s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6]\)$, where each $\(s_i\)$ can take values indicating the position of the leg (either in a supporting position labeled 1 to 5 or in a return position labeled 0).

2. **Action Space (A)**: Actions in this environment are the possible transitions between states, dictated by the movements of the legs. The action a robot can take from a state $\(P\)$ to a next state $\(P'\)$ depends on the current configuration of the legs and the commanded velocity $\(v_{unit}\)$. The FSG (Free State Generation) algorithm and modifications for rear-leg deficiency dynamically generate the available actions based on the current state and conditions.

3. **Reward Function (R)**: The reward $\(r\)$ is assigned after each transition based on the stability margin of the resulting state and the commanded velocity. The reward function aims to encourage transitions to states with larger stability margins and penalize transitions that lead to falls or unstable configurations. The reward $\(r_{sm}(n)\)$ for moving from state $\(P(n)\)$ to $\(P(n+1)\)$ at iteration $\(n\)$ is calculated as:

$$

r_{\text{sm}}(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{1 + e^{(7-sm_{n+1})}} - 0.5 & \text{if } sm_{n+1} < 7 \\
1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{(sm_{n+1}-7)}} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

$$


Where $\(sm_{n+1}\)$ is the stability margin of the next state $\(P(n+1)\)$, and $\(7\)$ is a nominal value for a desirable stability margin.

4. **Policy (Ï€)**: The policy is a strategy that the learning algorithm uses to decide the actions to take based on the current state. It aims to maximize the cumulative reward. The FGGRL (Free Gait Generation with Reinforcement Learning) dynamically updates the policy based on the observed rewards, utilizing reinforcement learning to favor transitions that have historically led to stable and efficient gaits.

5. **Learning Mechanism**: The learning mechanism updates the utilities (values) of state transitions based on the reinforcement signals received after each action. The utilities are used to inform the selection of actions (state transitions) in future iterations, favoring those that lead to higher rewards. The update rule for the utility $\(u_{P(n) \rightarrow P(n+1)}\)$ of transitioning from state $\(P(n)\)$ to $\(P(n+1)\)$ is influenced by the received reward $\(r_{sm}(n)\)$ and a discount factor $\(\gamma\)$, emphasizing the importance of recent transitions over older ones.


The reinforcement signal in the paper, designed to adapt and improve the robot's gait, particularly for enhancing its stability margin, is given as follows:



where \(r_{\text{sm}}(n)\) is the reinforcement signal after the \(n\)th iteration, and \(sm_{n+1}\) is the stability margin of the next state \(P(n+1)\). 

This formula was designed to issue a reward based on the stability margin of the robot's gait, with the goal of incentivizing higher stability margins. The use of the exponential function ensures a smooth transition of reward values around the critical stability margin threshold, encouraging the robot to seek gaits with stability margins close to or above this threshold.
