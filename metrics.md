The figures of merit to test whether the solution presented in the paper is good enough for the problem:

1. **Reward per Step**: Evaluates the immediate reinforcement signal returned after each iteration or step. A successful solution would show an increasing trend in rewards as the robot learns to walk more stably, especially in conditions like walking with five legs due to a leg deficiency.

2. **Average Reward**: The average reward over a set number of steps (e.g., the last ten steps) provides insight into the learning algorithm's consistency and stability over time. An increasing average reward indicates that the robot is consistently achieving higher rewards, suggesting improvements in gait stability and efficiency.

3. **Stability Margin per Step**: Measures the stability of the robot's gait. A larger stability margin indicates a more stable gait. The goal is to achieve and maintain a stability margin larger than a certain threshold (here: 7 cm), which would signify a successful adaptation and learning of stable gait patterns.

4. **Average Stability Margin**: Serves as a critical figure of merit for evaluating the effectiveness of the free gait generation and reinforcement learning solution in improving the six-legged robot's locomotion. This metric quantifies the average stability of the robot's gait over a series of steps, offering a measure of how well the learning algorithm optimizes gait patterns for stability across different conditions, including varying speeds and leg deficiencies

5. **Utilization of Memorized States and Transitions**: Assesses the algorithm's efficiency in utilizing learned gait patterns. It looks at the number of memorized states for each step and the average number of utilization of these memorized transitions or states. Successful learning would be indicated by a trend where initially, as the robot explores, the number of memorized states increases, but as it begins to exploit known stable gaits, the focus shifts to utilizing a consistent set of highly stable transitions.

6. **Speed of the Robot**: The ability of the robot to maintain or improve its speed while adapting its gait for stability is a critical figure of merit. Successful adaptation would allow the robot to adjust its speed in response to changes in the environment or its own stability, without significant losses in mobility efficiency.

7. **Learning Performance in Special Conditions**: Specifically, the learning performance when the robot faces a leg deficiency is crucial. The algorithm's success in enabling the robot to adapt to and compensate for the deficiency, as evidenced by stable walking patterns despite the handicap, is a significant indicator of the solution's robustness and adaptability.
