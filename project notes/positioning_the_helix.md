# best helix position in the robots reach

Strategically position the helix so that the robot's TCP can follow its trajectory within the robot's range and considering its joint angle constraints from -180° to 180°:

1) Helix Dimensions:  relatively small and manageable
2) Robot Reach and Workspace:

- total reach of the robot and its workspace geometry should surround the helix's trajectory
- position helix's base point within the robot's workspace, centered as much as possible to maximize accessibility.

3) Joint Constraints:

- joints can rotate from -180° to 180° --> wide range of motions.
- helix must be positioned so that the entire path remains within the robot's dexterous workspace where it can maintain good posture (avoiding singularities and joint limits)

## Positioning Strategy

- Center the Helix in the Robot's Workspace: Assuming the robot's base is at the origin (0,0,0), you should center the helix within the robot's effective reach. This doesn't necessarily mean the geometric center of the workspace but a position where the robot can reach all points of the helix comfortably.
- Height Adjustment: The helix starts from the ground up. Consider the robot's minimum and maximum reach in the Z-direction to adjust the base height of the helix. The helix should start at a height where the first point is comfortably reachable by the robot's end effector with the joints not too extended or retracted.
- Orientation Adjustment: Orient the helix so that its axis aligns with one of the robot's primary movement axes. This usually means having the helix's vertical axis align with the robot's vertical axis, simplifying the trajectory following.
- Initial Robot Configuration: Choose an initial robot configuration (joint angles) that places the TCP at the start of the helix with a favorable orientation for following the helix path. This often means avoiding extreme joint angles or configurations that could lead to singularities as the TCP moves along the helix.
- Path Planning and Simulation: Before physically executing the trajectory, use path planning algorithms to simulate the robot's movement along the helix. This can help identify any potential issues with joint limits, reachability, or collisions. Adjust the helix's position based on simulation outcomes if necessary.
- Incremental Adjustments: If the robot struggles to reach any part of the helix, make incremental adjustments to the helix's position or orientation. Small shifts can significantly impact the robot's ability to follow the trajectory smoothly.
- Joint Angle Monitoring: As the robot follows the helix, continuously monitor the joint angles to ensure they remain within the -180° to 180° range. Implement motion control algorithms that dynamically adjust the robot's configuration to maintain this constraint.
