# Testing and Validation

## Problem

The success of DQN training can be highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, including learning rate, discount factor (Î³), memory size, batch size, and the frequency of target network updates.

## solution

- Hyperparameter Tuning

- Experiments with different settings to find a combination that works well

- validation runs without exploration (epsilon = 0) to evaluate the performance of the learned policy without noisy explorations
